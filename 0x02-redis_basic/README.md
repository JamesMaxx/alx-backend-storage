# Redis Crash Course Tutorial

Redis is a key-value store built to handle high-speed data access. It's used as a database, cache, and message broker.

## Redis Commands

Here are some of the basic Redis commands:

- `SET key value` : Sets a key to a value
- `GET key` : Gets a value by key
- `DEL key` : Delete a key
- `KEYS pattern` : Find keys by pattern
- `EXPIRE key seconds` : Sets a key to expire in a specified number of seconds

## Redis Python Client

You can use the Python redis client to interact with Redis.

# Redis Crash Course Tutorial

This README file provides an introduction to Redis, a popular open-source in-memory data structure store, along with Redis commands, and how to use Redis with Python.

## What is Redis?

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and spatial indexes. Redis is often used as a cache for speeding up web applications and reducing the load on databases.

## Redis Commands

Redis provides a rich set of commands for interacting with different data structures. Here are some commonly used Redis commands:

- `SET key value`: Sets the string value of a key.
- `GET key`: Retrieves the value of a key.
- `LPUSH key value1 value2 ...`: Prepends one or multiple values to a list.
- `RPUSH key value1 value2 ...`: Appends one or multiple values to a list.
- `LRANGE key start stop`: Gets a range of elements from a list.
- `HSET key field value`: Sets the value of a hash field.
- `HGET key field`: Gets the value of a hash field.
- `SADD key member1 member2 ...`: Adds one or more members to a set.
- `SMEMBERS key`: Retrieves all members of a set.

## Redis Python Client

Python provides several clients for interacting with Redis. The most popular one is the `redis` package, which can be installed using `pip`:
